      <h2>Welcome to Play4Free.com!<h2>
    </div>
    <div id="info">
    <p>Play4Free is a community dedicated to raising awareness of small, independent, interactive art-pieces developed by programmers who put their heart and soul into created them that also happen to be free of charge with no strings attached. As a registered user, you will be able to add your game of choice to the Play4Free catalog for other users to enjoy. Maybe you developed the game or maybe you just want other to know of it, either way your playing a part in expanding the interactive art community we so proudly serve. </p>
    <p>To register a game, you must set up you own Play4Free account. Enter a valid Email Address, Username and Password in the Sign In form. Afterwords, go to the Add menu and register the game's Title, Cover Art Url (any thing with the title within it), the Mode (Single Player or Multiplayer), the Genre (action, platformer, shooter, ect.), the Download Link (a vaild website on where to download the game), and a brief description of the game (the more descript the better). After you submit the values given, you can then see the game on the Game page. Neat Huh.</p>
    <p>Before jumping ahead with the steps above, there are a few rules all users are required to follow.</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>No free games with microtransactions allowed (freemium isn't free)</li>
      <li>No games with blatant in-game advertisement (keep your GameStop billboards to yourself)</li>
      <li>No games or download links that contain spyware, viruses, or any potentially harmful programs (the internet can be an icky place)</li>
      <li>The game you register must be 100% entirely free (if the site's name wasn't clear enough)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>But it's not all rules and restrictions here, you have plenty of freedom in choosing what to list as well. Is it a DRM game? That's Fine. Is the game a browser only game? That's fine. Is the game on a different platform other than pc? That's fine. Is the game free because the developer wants to advertise their company for later paid games? Totally fine. This website is always developing and so is the community and your contribution helps us both.</p>
